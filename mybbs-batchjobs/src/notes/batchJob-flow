Tips:

	1. for Step 1, due to the source page settings may not be changed frequently,
		so in the future, the data may load from cache, 
		if the page source settings is changed in bbs-admin, 
		then a notification will be sent to jms, before step 1 , 
		try to get the notification from jms,
		if data has been changed, load from db, else load form cache.
		
	2. File Synchronization.*
		when bbs-batch generate the file with the fit urls, 
		if concurrent, the app need to load the urls in the file, how to make it correct?
